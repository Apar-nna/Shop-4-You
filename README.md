An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. -Front end: Html,css -Back end: php -Data base: mysql

A static e-commerce website is an online platform designed for buying and selling products with a fixed, unchanging structure. It includes two main user roles: administrators and customers.

**Admin Panel:**

- **Admin Login:** The website features a secure login portal for administrators to access the admin panel, ensuring that only authorized individuals can make changes to the website.

- **Product Management:** Administrators have the ability to add new products to the website. This includes providing details such as product names, descriptions, prices, images, and categories. They can also edit or delete existing product listings.

- **CRUD Operations:** The admin panel supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products. This means administrators can create new product listings, view the list of available products, update product information, and remove products from the catalog.

- **Customer Approval:** Administrators have control over customer access. They can approve or disapprove customers, granting or denying access to the e-commerce platform.

**Customer Access:**

- **Customer Login:** Registered customers can log in to the website using their personal credentials, enabling them to access various e-commerce features.

- **Product Browsing:** Customers can explore the product catalog, viewing details such as product descriptions, prices, and product images. This allows customers to browse the available products.

- **Add to Cart:** Customers can add desired products to their shopping cart, creating a list of items they intend to purchase.

- **Checkout:** Customers have the option to proceed to the checkout process. During checkout, they can review the contents of their shopping cart, enter shipping and payment information, and confirm their order.

- **Purchase:** Once the checkout process is completed, customers can make a purchase. This action records the order information for both the customer and the administrator.

This static e-commerce website provides a basic but functional environment for product management and customer interactions. It is a cost-effective solution suitable for businesses with a limited product catalog and those looking for a simple and easy-to-maintain online presence. However, it may have limitations in terms of scalability and advanced e-commerce features, making it more suitable for smaller businesses.
